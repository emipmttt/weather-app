![796_1x_shots_so](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/109dc79e-0475-4b11-9d81-46a59f68550f)


This project is a React application built using Vite, DaisyUI, and Recharts to display weather forecasts. The app allows users to search for cities, view a list of available places, and check the weather forecast for selected cities over the next 5 days. The weather data is visualized using bar charts to show minimum and maximum temperatures.

## Code Challenge

This application was created as part of a coding challenge to demonstrate the ability to integrate APIs, manage application state, and visualize data using charts.

The project was developed by Emiliano Pacheco.

## Features

- **City Search**: Users can input city names to search for places.
- **Places List**: Displays a horizontal scrollable list of places.
- **Weather Forecast**: Shows weather data for selected cities, with charts displaying min and max temperatures.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Vite**: For fast development and bundling.
- **DaisyUI**: For UI components and styling.
- **Recharts**: For charting and data visualization.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety.

## API Integration

- **Reservamos API**: Used to get city data and geographic coordinates.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Used to get weather forecasts based on coordinates.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3. **Open the application in your browser:**

    Visit `http://localhost:5173/` to view the app.

## Usage
